# Server Side Rendering of Web Components

This project is a proof-of-concept for server-side rendering of Polymer web components using an [Electron] server. Server-side rendering of web components provides several benefits, including faster initial load time, indexability of the web components for SEO purposes, and exposure of their content for content previews. 

## Overview
---
The server currently has three approaches for the rendering. The first approach deals with documents that use Polymer's [shady DOM]. The second approach is for documents that use native [shadow DOM]. The third is a hybrid approach that first sends down Shady CSS and later upgrades the custom elements to use shadow DOM. This approach was inspired by issues encountered in the other two.

## Setup
---

#### Installation
Before setting up, install [Node.js] and npm.

Install Electron:
```
npm install electron --save-dev
```

or globally:
```
npm install -g electron
```

Install Bower:
```
npm install bower
```

Clone the project:
```
git clone git@github.com:namchid/Electron-SSR-Web-Components.git
```

Install/update packages for Polymer and Node. **Note: This step will set up server dependencies, but not download example tests. See next step.**
```
bower update
npm update
```

Alternatively, execute the RUNME script to install Polymer and Node packages (same as previous step) and download files for testing.
```
./runme
```

Run Electron app locally
```
electron .
```

If all the dependencies are present and this project is configured correctly, you should see something like this in the console:
```
Shady ngrok url: https://133d08a1.ngrok.io
Shadow ngrok url: https://0d2c7ec2.ngrok.io
```
These are URLs randomly generated by ngrok for secure tunneling of locally hosted servers. See the ***Testing Server Performance*** section below for more details, or visit the [ngrok repository].

#### Viewing the Results
Executing the `runme` will automatically download some test cases. The test cases that use shady DOM follow the naming format `index[0-9]*.html`; ones that use shadow DOM follow the naming format of `index[0-9]*shadow.html`.

To see the server-rendered results, navigate to the browser. For server-rendered pages that use shady DOM, go to port 3000. For pages that use shadow DOM, go to port 4000. Alternatively, you can use to one of the corresponding, generated [ngrok] URLs logged in the console.

Example:
```
https://localhost:3000/index.html
https://localhost:4000/indexshadow.html
```

#### Adding Custom Test Cases
Documents that use shady DOM must follow this naming convention: `index[0-9]*.html`. Those that use shadow DOM must follow this naming convention: `index[0-9]*shadow.html`. When adding additional test cases, add the index or main HTML files to root directory. Add all other files in the `src` folder.

If you prefer a different naming scheme or directory structure, add or modify the routes in `_server.js`.

#### Testing Server Performance
One way to test the performance of this server is through [WebpageTest]. Because ngrok exposes the server to the Internet, you can use the generated ngrok URL followed by the name of the file to test. 

## Notes
---
Parts of the JavaScript code executed on the server for serving documents that use shadow DOM are adapted from Kevin Schaaf's [WC-SSR].

At the moment there are separate routes for rendering pages with shady and shadow DOM (see the ***Viewing the Results*** subsection under the ***Setup*** section). Eventually, 

The hybrid version mentioned in ***Overview*** is currently not hooked in, but it is easy to do so by adding another route in `_server.js`.

This project works best on Chrome. Compatibility in other browsers is not assured.
